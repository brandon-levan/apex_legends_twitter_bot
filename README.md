# Apex Legends Twitter Bot

## Summary
The goal of this project was to give Apex players worldwide a feed that would display information about what loot is available in the Replicator for the current day. The solution I created is a Twitter account that posts a picture of table containing all of the items that can be found in the Replicator on the current day including attributes such as item name, rarity, cost, when the item enters and leaves the Replicator, and whether the loot item is in the Replicator for the day, week, or for the entire season. 

## Solution 

The solution was built using Python, Docker, and AWS. The solution was created with the following steps - 

* Get Data From the Apex Legends Status Crafting Rotation API
* Clean and Format Returned JSON as a Pandas Data Frame
* Convert Data Frame to an Image File
* Send Image File to an AWS S3 Bucket
* Read Image File Back into Script in Memory From S3
* Tweet Out the Information Using Tweepy Package 

### Infrastructure
* Python Script That Does All Steps Above is Packaged Using Docker. Container is Uploaded to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) 
* Container in AWS ECR is Run Using an AWS Lambda Function 
* AWS Lambda Function is Scheduled to Run Daily By Using AWS EventBirdge (Formerly AWS CloudWatch) 

Credentials for AWS, Apex Legends API, and Twitter are all stored in AWS Secrets Manager and are passed to the Python script using Boto3. Permissions on the AWS side are configured using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
